# patch-texthooker.sh - Apply patches to texthooker-ui
#
# This script patches texthooker-ui to handle empty sentences from mpv.
# When subtitles disappear, mpv sends {"sentence":""} which would otherwise
# display as raw JSON on the texthooker page.
#
# Usage: ./patch-texthooker.sh [texthooker_dir]
#   texthooker_dir: Path to the texthooker-ui directory (default: vendor/texthooker-ui)
